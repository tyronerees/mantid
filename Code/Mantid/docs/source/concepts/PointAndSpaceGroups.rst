Point and space groups
======================

This document explains how crystallographic point and space groups are used in Mantid. The :ref:`document <Symmetry groups>` about symmetry operations, elements and groups is a prerequisite for this text, so it is recommended to read it beforehand.

Introduction
------------

As explained in the general text covering symmetry groups, groups are used to describe symmetry of objects in space. For crystallography, point and space groups are essential tools to describe crystal structures and aspects of diffraction experiments. According to the definition given in the International Tables for Crystallography A, a "point group is a group of symmetry operations all of which leave at least one point unmoved" [ITAPointGroups]_. This means that only symmetry operations without a translational component are allowed, which leaves only rotations :math:`1`, :math:`2`, :math:`3`, :math:`4`, :math:`6` and roto-inversions :math:`\bar{1}`, :math:`\bar{3}`, :math:`\bar{4}`, :math:`\bar{6}` and mirror planes :math:`m`. In space groups, translational symmetry is present as well (for example in the form of screw axes and glide planes).

Theory
------

In three dimensions there are 32 crystallographic point groups and in 11 of these an inversion center (:math:`\bar{1}`) is present. These so called Laue classes are important for diffraction experiments because Friedel's law defines that diffraction patterns always show a center of symmetry if anomalous dispersion is not taken into account.

Through the presence of certain symmetry operations in certain directions, the Laue classes (and also the point groups) can be categorized into seven crystal systems (see table below). This information is included in the Hermann-Mauguin symbol, which describes symmetry along different directions, depending on the crystal system.

Any point group can be generated by using a maximum of three symmetry operations as so-called generators using the principle described in [Shmueli84]_. According to this, any point group can be described either as a cyclic group or as a product of maximum three cyclic groups. The point group :math:`4` is an example for a group that is simply a cyclic group generated from a positive four fold rotation axis along the :math:`z`-axis, which has the order 4.

.. math::
    G = \left\{{4^{+}}^0, {4^{+}}^1, {4^{+}}^2, {4^{+}}^3\right\} = \left\{1, 4^{+}, 2, 4^{-}\right\}
    
So by specifying one single symmetry operation as generator, all symmetry operations of the point group in question are generated. From this it's convenient to expand the example to generate a point group that can be expressed as the product of two cyclic groups - :math:`4/m`. In this point group, an additional mirror plane is present perpendicular to the four fold axis. The point group can be expressed as product of :math:`4` shown above and a cyclic group generated by the symmetry operation :math:`m` (mirror plane perpendicular to :math:`z`):

.. math::
    G' = G \cdot \left\{m^0, m^1\right\} = \left\{1, 4^{+}, 2, 4^{-}\right\} \cdot \left\{1, m\right\} = \left\{1, m, 4^{+}, \bar{4}^{+}, 2, \bar{1}, 4^{-}, \bar{4}^{-}\right\}
    
This means that :math:`4/m` contains an inversion center as well as a four fold rotoinversion axis which result from the combination of the operations of the two cyclic groups. It's also possible to use a different cyclic group to achive the same result (:math:`\bar{1}`). As mentioned above, for some point groups it's necessary to use three generators, which follows the same principle and is not shown here.

Space groups can be handled in a very similar way if translations are limited to the interval :math:`[0, 1)` so that screw-axes and glide-planes can also be used to generate cyclic groups. Without this limitation, the translational components would not be the same for :math:`S^k` and :math:`S^0`.

Using point groups in Mantid
----------------------------

Point groups are represented in Mantid by the ``PointGroup``-class, which is constructed for each actual point group using generators. The interface of the class consists of two parts, one for providing information about the point group and one for working with :math:`hkl`-indices. Just as in the case of ``SymmetryOperation``, ``PointGroup``-objects are created using a factory, this time by supplying the short Hermann-Mauguin symbol [#f1]_ :

.. testcode :: ExInformation

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory
    
    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroup("-1")
    
    print "Name:", pg.getName()
    print "Hermann-Mauguin symbol:", pg.getHMSymbol()
    print "Crystal system:", pg.getCrystalSystem()
    
When this code is executed, some information about the point group is printed:
    
.. testoutput :: ExInformation

    Name: -1 (Triclinic)
    Hermann-Mauguin symbol: -1
    Crystal system: Triclinic
    
It's possible to query the factory about available point groups. One option returns a list of all available groups, while another possibility is to get only groups from a certain crystal system:

.. testcode :: ExQueryPointGroups

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory, PointGroup
    
    print "All point groups:", PointGroupFactory.getAllPointGroupSymbols()
    print "Cubic point groups:", PointGroupFactory.getPointGroupSymbols(PointGroup.CrystalSystem.Cubic)
    print "Tetragonal point groups:", PointGroupFactory.getPointGroupSymbols(PointGroup.CrystalSystem.Tetragonal)
    
Which results in the following output:

.. testoutput :: ExQueryPointGroups

    All point groups: ['-1','-3','-3 r','-31m','-3m','-3m r','-3m1','-4','-42m','-43m','-4m2','-6','-62m','-6m2','1','112/m','2','2/m','222','23','3','3 r','312','31m','32','32 r','321','3m','3m r','3m1','4','4/m','4/mmm','422','432','4mm','6','6/m','6/mmm','622','6mm','m','m-3','m-3m','mm2','mmm']
    Cubic point groups: ['-43m','23','432','m-3','m-3m']
    Tetragonal point groups: ['-4','-42m','-4m2','4','4/m','4/mmm','422','4mm']

The point groups with an extra ``r`` at the end are trigonal point groups with rhombohedral axes. Trigonal point groups without that additional letter use the hexagonal coordinate system. For some of them there are two different axis choices, for example :math:`\bar{3}m`, which can be defined as :math:`\bar{3}m1` or :math:`\bar{3}1m`. Creating it by the symbol ``-3m`` defaults to :math:`\bar{3}m1`.

After having obtained a ``PointGroup``-object, it can be used for working with reflection data, more specifically :math:`hkl`-indices. It's possible to check whether two reflections are equivalent in a certain point group:

.. testcode :: ExIsEquivalent

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory

    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroup("m-3m")

    hkl1 = [2, 0, 0]
    hkl2 = [0, 0, -2]
    hkl3 = [0, 1, 2]

    print "Are [2,0,0] and [0,0,-2] equivalent?", pg.isEquivalent(hkl1, hkl2)
    print "Are [2,0,0] and [0,1,2] equivalent?", pg.isEquivalent(hkl1, hkl3)
    
.. testoutput :: ExIsEquivalent

    Are [2,0,0] and [0,0,-2] equivalent? True
    Are [2,0,0] and [0,1,2] equivalent? False
    
Another common task is to find all symmetry equivalents of a reflection, for example to determine its multiplicity. ``PointGroup`` has a method for this purpose which returns the set of non-identical symmetry equivalents for a given :math:`hkl` (including :math:`hkl` itself):

.. testcode :: ExGetEquivalents

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory

    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroup("m-3m")

    hkl1 = [2, 0, 0]
    equivalents1 = pg.getEquivalents(hkl1)

    print "Number of reflections equivalent to [2,0,0]:", len(equivalents1)
    print "Equivalents:", equivalents1
    print

    hkl2 = [1, 1, 1]
    equivalents2 = pg.getEquivalents(hkl2)

    print "Number of reflections equivalent to [1,1,1]:", len(equivalents2)
    print "Equivalents:", equivalents2
    
Executing this code results in the following output:
    
.. testoutput :: ExGetEquivalents

    Number of reflections equivalent to [2,0,0]: 6
    Equivalents: [[2,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,2], [0,0,-2], [0,-2,0], [-2,0,0]]
    
    Number of reflections equivalent to [1,1,1]: 8
    Equivalents: [[1,1,1], [1,1,-1], [1,-1,1], [1,-1,-1], [-1,1,1], [-1,1,-1], [-1,-1,1], [-1,-1,-1]]
    
Sometimes, a list of reflections needs to be reduced to a set of symmetry independent reflections only. That means it should not contain any two reflections that are symmetry equivalents according to the point group symmetry. To achieve this, ``PointGroup`` offers a method that returns the same :math:`hkl'` for all symmetry equivalents.

.. testcode :: ExIndependentReflections

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory

    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroup("m-3m")

    hklList = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0],    # Equivalent to [1,0,0]
               [1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1],               # Equivalent to [1,1,1]
               [-3, 1, 1], [1, -3, 1], [-1, 1, 3]]  # Equivalent to [3,1,1]
                 
    independent = set()

    for hkl in hklList:
        independent.add(pg.getReflectionFamily(hkl)) # getReflectionFamily returns the same hkl for all symmetry equivalents
        
    print "Number of independent reflections:", len(independent)
    print "Reflections:", list(independent)
    
This example code produces the output below upon execution:

.. testoutput:: ExIndependentReflections

    Number of independent reflections: 3
    Reflections: [[1,1,1], [1,0,0], [3,1,1]]

This is all that's covered by the Python interface regarding point groups in Mantid at the time of this writing. The use in C++ is very similar and described in detail in the API documentation.
    
Using space groups in Mantid
----------------------------

Space group representation in Mantid is very similar to the point group representation, there is a ``SpaceGroup``-class that contains some information about the group, but also a method to generate equivalent positions from a coordinate triplet.

Exactly like point groups, space groups are also created using a factory:

.. testcode:: ExSpaceGroupInfo

    from mantid.geometry import SpaceGroupFactory
    
    sg = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P -1")
    print "Hermann-Mauguin symbol:", sg.getHMSymbol()
    print "ITA number:", sg.getNumber()
    
Executing this code shows the Hermann-Mauguin symbol of the space group as well as the number defined in ITA:

.. testoutput:: ExSpaceGroupInfo

    Hermann-Mauguin symbol: P -1
    ITA number: 2
    
For some space group types there is more than one setting. Even though these are not present in Mantid at the time of this writing, the factory already supports querying the available symbols for a given number:

.. testcode:: ExSpaceGroupNumber

    from mantid.geometry import SpaceGroupFactory
    
    print "Space group no. 2:", SpaceGroupFactory.subscribedSpaceGroupSymbols(2)
    print "Total subscribed space group types:", len(SpaceGroupFactory.getAllSpaceGroupNumbers())
    
This shows that only one symbol is registered for space group number 2, and that there are 230 space group types:

.. testoutput:: ExSpaceGroupNumber

    Space group no. 2: ['P -1']
    Total subscribed space group types: 230

Besides containing some very basic information, the most important functionality is the ability to generate equivalent coordinates. The following example generates all coordinates for the :math:`4h` position in space group :math:`P6/m` (No. 175):

.. testcode:: ExEquivalentCoordinates

    from mantid.geometry import SpaceGroupFactory
    
    sg = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P 6/m")
    
    position = [1./3., 2./3., 0.25]
    equivalents = sg.getEquivalentPositions(position)
    
    print "There are", len(equivalents), "equivalent coordinates."
    print "Coordinates:"
    for i, pos in enumerate(equivalents):
        print str(i + 1) + ":", pos
        
Please note that for hexagonal and trigonal space groups, where translations of :math:`1/3`, :math:`2/3`, :math:`1/6` and so on are common, these coordinates must be supplied either as ``1./3.`` or with a precision of 7 digits, e.g. ``0.6666667``.
        
.. testoutput:: ExEquivalentCoordinates

    There are 4 equivalent coordinates.
    Coordinates:
    1: [0.333333,0.666667,0.25]
    2: [0.333333,0.666667,0.75]
    3: [0.666667,0.333333,0.25]
    4: [0.666667,0.333333,0.75]
    
Furthermore, it is possible to create a PointGroup-object from a SpaceGroup object in order to obtain information about the crystal system and to perform the Miller index operations provided by PointGroup. For this, PointGroupFactory has a special method:

.. testcode:: ExPointGroupFromSpaceGroup

    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory, SpaceGroupFactory

    # Create space group Fd-3m (for example silicon or diamond)
    sg = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("F d -3 m")
    
    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroupFromSpaceGroup(sg)
    
    print "Space group no.", sg.getNumber(), "has point group:", pg.getHMSymbol()
    
The script prints the point group of the space group in question:
    
.. testoutput:: ExPointGroupFromSpaceGroup

    Space group no. 227 has point group: m-3m
    
Very similar constructions are available in C++ as well, as shown in the API documentation.
    
Other ways of using groups in Mantid
------------------------------------

The previous two sections demonstrated how to perform common tasks using point and space groups in Mantid. With the available Python tools it is however possible to obtain other information as well. One useful method that both PointGroup and SpaceGroup expose is to query the symmetry operations of the group, although in string format:

.. testcode:: ExGroupSymmetryOperationStrings

    from mantid.geometry import SpaceGroupFactory
    
    sg = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P 6/m")    
    symOpStrings = sorted(sg.getSymmetryOperationStrings())
    
    print "There are", len(symOpStrings), "symmetry operations in space group", sg.getHMSymbol() + "."
    print "Symmetry operations:", symOpStrings
    
Which prints the symmetry operation information:

.. testoutput:: ExGroupSymmetryOperationStrings

    There are 12 symmetry operations in space group P 6/m.
    Symmetry operations: ['-x+y,-x,-z', '-x+y,-x,z', '-x,-y,-z', '-x,-y,z', '-y,x-y,-z', '-y,x-y,z', 'x,y,-z', 'x,y,z', 'x-y,x,-z', 'x-y,x,z', 'y,-x+y,-z', 'y,-x+y,z']
    
While this can be interesting for informational purposes, it's more useful to obtain the symmetry operations directly as objects to use them for new purposes. This script for example sorts the contained symmetry operations according to their order:

.. testcode:: ExGroupSymmetryOperations

    from mantid.geometry import SpaceGroupFactory
    
    def getMaximumOrderOperation(spaceGroup):
        return sorted(spaceGroup.getSymmetryOperations(), key=lambda x: x.getOrder())[-1]
    
    sg1 = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P 6/m")
    sg2 = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P 4 3 2")
    
    # Get the symmetry operation with the highest order
    symOpMax1 = getMaximumOrderOperation(sg1)
    symOpMax2 = getMaximumOrderOperation(sg2)
    
    print "The symmetry operation with highest order in space group no.", sg1.getNumber(), "is:", symOpMax1.getIdentifier(), "(k=" + str(symOpMax1.getOrder()) + ")"
    print "The symmetry operation with highest order in space group no.", sg2.getNumber(), "is:", symOpMax2.getIdentifier(), "(k=" + str(symOpMax2.getOrder()) + ")"
    
Which produces the following output:

.. testoutput:: ExGroupSymmetryOperations

    The symmetry operation with highest order in space group no. 175 is: y,-x+y,z (k=6)
    The symmetry operation with highest order in space group no. 207 is: z,y,-x (k=4)
    
Another way to extract more information about the symmetry in a space group is to obtain the symmetry elements and arrange them by their characteristic axis:

.. testcode:: ExGroupSymmetryElements

    from mantid.kernel import V3D
    from mantid.geometry import PointGroupFactory, SpaceGroupFactory, SymmetryElementFactory

    def getSymmetryElementsFromOperations(symmetryOperations):
        return [SymmetryElementFactory.createSymElement(x) for x in symmetryOperations]

    sg = SpaceGroupFactory.createSpaceGroup("P n m a")
    pg = PointGroupFactory.createPointGroupFromSpaceGroup(sg)

    symElements = getSymmetryElementsFromOperations(sg.getSymmetryOperations())    
    symElementsByAxis = {}
    symElementsNoAxis = []

    for symElem in symElements:
        axis = pg.getReflectionFamily(symElem.getAxis())
        #axis = symElem.getAxis()
        
        # If axis is [0,0,0], put the element into the "no axis" list
        if axis == V3D(0, 0, 0):
            symElementsNoAxis.append(symElem)
        else:
            # Otherwise check if that axis is already in the dictionary with a list...
            if axis in symElementsByAxis.keys():
                symElementsByAxis[axis].append(symElem)
            # ...or create a new list for that axis
            else:
                symElementsByAxis[axis] = [symElem]

    noAxisSymbols = [x.getHMSymbol() for x in symElementsNoAxis]
    print "There are", len(symElementsNoAxis), "element(s) with no characteristic axis."
    print "Are there translations?", "Yes" if 't' in noAxisSymbols else "No"

    axes = symElementsByAxis.keys()
    print "There is a total of", len(axes), "different characteristic axes."
    print "Symmetry in each direction:"

    for axis in sorted(axes):
        print str(axis) + ": ", sorted([x.getHMSymbol() for x in symElementsByAxis[axis]])
        
This prints the following information:

.. testoutput:: ExGroupSymmetryElements

    There are 2 element(s) with no characteristic axis.
    Are there translations? No
    There is a total of 3 different characteristic axes.
    Symmetry in each direction:
    [0,0,1]:  ['21', 'a']
    [0,1,0]:  ['21', 'm']
    [1,0,0]:  ['21', 'n']
    
Looking up space group number 62 (:math:`Pnma` from the example) in ITA shows that the full Hermann-Mauguin symbol for that space group is :math:`P 2_1/n 2_1/m 2_1/a`. The short script gives us all of this information, since there are no translations (the primitive lattice translations are implicit) it must be a primitive lattice (:math:`P`) and all directions encoded in the HM-symbol contain a :math:`2_1` screw axis perpendicular to a glide or mirror plane.

.. [Shmueli84] U. Shmueli, Acta Crystallogr. A, 40, p. 559 `DOI: 10.1107/S0108767384001161 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0108767384001161>`_)

.. [#f1] In the case of the monoclinic Laue class :math:`2/m` it's a bit more complicated, because there are two conventions regarding the unique axis. According to current crystallographic standards, the :math:`b`-axis is used, but in some cases one may find the :math:`c`-axis for this purpose. To resolve this, both options are offered in Mantid. When using the symbol ``2/m``, the :math:`b`-axis convention is used, for :math:`c` one has to explicitly provide the symbol as ``112/m``.
