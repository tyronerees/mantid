Description
-----------

.. warning::

   This algorithm is being developed for a specific instrument. It might get changed or even
   removed without a notification, should instrument scientists decide to do so.


The pattern is specified by providing a list of dSpacing values where Bragg peaks are expected. The algorithm then fits peaks in those areas using a peak fitting function. The dSpacing values for ExpectedPeaks are then converted by Mantid's convertUnits function to TOF.

These values are used as start peak position in fit. It is these adjusted peak TOF value positions that are fitted against ExpectedPeaks dSpacing values according to:


.. math:: TOF = DifC*d + Zero


ZERO and Difc can then be used within the GSAS program.

Usage
-----

**Example - Fitting two peaks:**

.. testcode:: ExTwoPeaks

   # Two B2B peaks
   peak1 = "name=BackToBackExponential,I=4000,A=1,B=0.5,X0=12000,S=350"
   peak2 = "name=BackToBackExponential,I=5000,A=1,B=0.7,X0=35000,S=300"

   # Create workpsace with the above peaks and a single detector pixel
   ws = CreateSampleWorkspace(Function="User Defined",
                              UserDefinedFunction=peak1 + ";" + peak2,
                              NumBanks=1,
                              BankPixelWidth=1,
                              XMin=6000,
                              XMax=45000,
                              BinWidth=10)

   # Update instrument geometry to something that would allow converting to some sane dSpacing values
   EditInstrumentGeometry(Workspace = ws, L2 = [1.5], Polar = [90], PrimaryFlightPath = 50)

   # Run the algorithm. Defaults are shown below. Files entered must be in .csv format and if both ExpectedPeaks and ExpectedPeaksFromFile are entered, the latter will be used.
   # difc, zero = EnginXFitPeaks(InputWorkspace = No default, WorkspaceIndex = None, ExpectedPeaks=[0.6, 1.9], ExpectedPeaksFromFile=None)

   difc, zero = EnginXFitPeaks(ws, 0, [0.65, 1.9])



   # Print the results
   print "Difc: %.1f" % difc
   print "Zero: %.1f" % zero

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExTwoPeaks

   Difc: 18400.0
   Zero: 46.0
