Description
-----------

.. warning::

   This algorithm is being developed for a specific instrument. It might get changed or even 
   removed without a notification, should instrument scientists decide to do so.

Performs a TOF to dSpacing conversion using calibrated pixel
positions, focuses the values in dSpacing and then converts them back
to TOF. The output workspace produced by this algorithm has one
spectrum.

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

**Example - Simple focussing of and EnginX data file:**

.. testcode:: ExSimple

   # Run the algorithm
   ws = EnginXFocus(Filename="ENGINX00213855.nxs",
   			   		Bank=1)

   # Should have one spectrum only
   print "No. of spectra:", ws.getNumberHistograms()

   # Print a few arbitrary bins where higher intensities are expected
   fmt = "For TOF of {0:.3f} intensity is {1:.3f}"
   for bin in [3169, 6037, 7124]:
     print fmt.format(ws.readX(0)[bin], ws.readY(0)[bin])

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExSimple

   No. of spectra: 1
   For TOF of 20165.642 intensity is 7.436
   For TOF of 33547.826 intensity is 9.388
   For TOF of 38619.804 intensity is 17.397
