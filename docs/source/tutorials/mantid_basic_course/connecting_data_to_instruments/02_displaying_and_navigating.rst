Different projections
=====================

There are two ways to display the instrument geometry: the 3D view and
an "unwrapped" view. An "unwrapped" view shows a projection of the
instrument onto a surface (a cylinder or a sphere) unfolded onto the
screen. Use this drop-down menu to select the type of the projection
