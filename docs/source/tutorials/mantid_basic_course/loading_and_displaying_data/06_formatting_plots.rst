Floating and Docking a Window
=============================

By default on Windows a plot window will be floating, meaning it can be
dragged outside the main MantidPlot work area. For Linux versions,
windows do not float by default as they have a tendency to get lost
behind the main application window. The state of the selected window can
be controlled using the "Windows Menu".

#. Use "Windows->Change to docked". This will dock this plot window
   within MantidPlot.
#. Use "Windows->Change to floating" to float it again.

The Plot Toolbar
================

This toolbar is only active when a plot window is selected.

Adjusting the Properties of Plot Windows
========================================

Many aspects of these graphs can be adjusted to fit how you want to
display the data. Just double-click on the item you want to change. For
example, the following are editable:

-  The graph title.
-  The legend text. You may also move the legend by selecting and
   dragging it.
-  The axes labels.
-  The axes themselves. You can change the range, scaling and gridlines,
   or even introduce axis breaks.
-  A curve allows you to set the line colour and styles.
-  Double-clicking the "1" in the corner allows you to remove curves or
   add them from other graphs.

Quickly changing to Log axes
----------------------------

We have a fast way to change the axes between log an linear as this is
such a common operation.

#. Right-click within the plot.
#. Select "Axes" to quickly switch the X and Y axes.
#. Select "Color Bar" to quickly switch the colour bar scaling.
