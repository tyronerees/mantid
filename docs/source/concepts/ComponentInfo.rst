Introduction
------------
``ComponentInfo`` provides faster and simpler access to instrument/beamline geometry as required by Mantid :ref:`Algorithms <Algorithm>` than was possible using :ref:`Instrument`. ``ComponentInfo`` and :ref:`DetectorInfo` are designed as full replacements to :ref:`Instrument`. At the time of writing, `ComponentInfo` is incomplete.

Until complete, :ref:`Instrument Access Layers <InstrumentAccessLayers>` provides the best details on how `ComponentInfo` can be used in it's current state of implementation.
