Introduction
------------
``DetectorInfo`` provides faster and simpler access to instrument/beamline detector geometry and metadata as required by Mantid :ref:`Algorithms <Algorithm>` than was possible using :ref:`Instrument`. ``DetectorInfo`` and :ref:`ComponentInfo` are designed as full replacements to :ref:`Instrument`. At the time of writing, `DetectorInfo` is incomplete.

Until complete, :ref:`Instrument Access Layers <InstrumentAccessLayers>` provides the best details on how `DetectorInfo` can be used in it's current state of implementation.
