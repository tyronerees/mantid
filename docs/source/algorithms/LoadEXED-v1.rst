Description
-----------
This is an experimental algorithm to load data from the Exed instrument at HZB
It reads raw files and creates two workspaces.  One for the detectors and another for the monitor.
This is a python version based of the C++ version written by Wolf-Dieter Stein.
Modifications have been made by Maciej Bartkowiak and Garrett Granroth (ORNL) in 2017,
in order to fully replace the C++ version of LoadEXED, load all of the available logs,
and improve the treatment of the
monitor spectra.
